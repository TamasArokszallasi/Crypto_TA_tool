# Crypto_TA_tool
# Technical Analysis Tool for Candlestick Patterns with cryptocurrencies.

## Project Description
On my way of learning data analytics with python, sql and data visualising tools, i am constantly looking for projects that can challange my skills and i do own interest in the topic itself as well. 
I met the cryptocurrencies firstly in 2017, and since then i am constanly following it and looking with childish curiosity on what would be the next great innovation that can be solved by the blockchain industry itself. 
Furthermore, i do graduated as an economist, and have an urge to do analysis whenever i can on whatever come across. I think that's enoguh for the short sotrytelling, let me introduce the question, methodology and answers that made this project to be done.

##Hypothesis 1
Currently one of the hottest topic in cryptocurrency trading is looking at the japaneese candlestick charts to find some patterns and indicator signals that can predict the next move.
Do Japaneese candlestick pattern appearance can signal a price movment, and if yes, in a precision that it could be worth to follow it?


##Hypothesis 2
As i mentioned previously, i am looking over this industry weekly, sometimes daily, it depends on my business. But, what i do recognized is that cryptocurrency pairs against the USD are tend to move simoultaneously in the same direction. 
now at this point my hypothesis may extend into 2 or 3 hypothesis. I am wondering, which pair follows which movement? How to capture a movement? 


##Hypothesis 3
What other variables can be useful in terms of capturing the movements of the currencies? Central banks ?

Okay, so in general economics, when we are using a variable to analyse for example the fxrate of a currency, we must reason it why we are using that variable. We must cite the one who have previously used this variable and tested, basically created it.
What would happen if we can create a variable which currently does not have any literature to use, is that makes the whole thing untrustful?
